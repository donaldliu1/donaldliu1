# About me ðŸ¤“

ðŸ˜Š Hello! I just finished studying at the School of Code, learning a plethora of different languages and software. Looking to challenge myself, I've made several passion projects to help me learn along the way! Have a look.

ðŸŽ“ I've always been into coding, having done Software Development in college and a bit of Python while studying at the University of Salford.

ðŸ’» The School of Code bootcamp has helped push me out of my comfort zone and really reinforced my passion for joining the tech industry.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own personal project which is centered around Pokemon TCG!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Tailwind.
